# Drones Bootcamp üõ∏üöÅ

Welcome to the **Drones Bootcamp** repository! Here you will find six exciting drone control programs, designed to get you started with programming drones using the `djitellopy` library. Each script offers different functionalities and control techniques for DJI Tello drones. These projects will help you learn the basics of drone control, image processing, and keypress-based interaction with drones.

## üöÄ Projects

Here are the six main projects included in this bootcamp:

1. **Basic Movement (`BaicMovement.py`)**:
   - Controls the basic movement of the drone: takeoff, forward, backward, turn, and landing.
   - Demonstrates how to send control commands to a drone.

2. **Image Capture (`ImageCaption.py`)**:
   - Streams live video from the drone‚Äôs camera and displays it using OpenCV.
   - Enables capturing images from the drone‚Äôs camera in real-time.

3. **KeyPress Control (`KeyPressCode.py`)**:
   - Uses keyboard input to control the drone‚Äôs movement.
   - Includes functionality for takeoff, landing, and movement in different directions using the arrow keys.

4. **Surveillance Mode (`Surveillance.py`)**:
   - Implements surveillance functionality where the drone can move and capture images based on keypress commands.
   - Includes a simple method to save images from the drone‚Äôs camera during flight.

5. **Face Tracking (`FaceTracking.py`)**:
   - Uses OpenCV to detect faces in the drone's camera feed and makes the drone follow the face.
   - Ideal for automated face-tracking applications.

6. **KeyPress Module (`KeyPressModule.py`)**:
   - A separate module to handle keypress detection using the `pygame` library.
   - It provides a way to manage keyboard inputs to control the drone's behavior.
